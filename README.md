### I.	Project statement: 

**Motivation:**
The motivation for this project came from my earlier project that I have done on Mass shootings in the states. My main driving source for taking up this challenging project was to see that what are the underlying causes of so many mass shootings in the states and to prove or discredit the theory that the media has been talking about that the lenient gun laws are the root cause of people with or without criminal history killing innocent citizens without any cause.In my  My deception project I have tried to do something different but related to Gun Laws. I plan to analyze data on suicides in the states using Gun and see where it leads me. After finishing up the Project I hope to achieve a clear understanding of why such heinous crimes took place and are suicide related to gun laws in any way.



**Objective:** 
Today, data is become a driving force to make decisions  affecting millions of people. Since this is a deceptive project, I will try to show what the data actually tells its viewer and how can it be manipulated to something completely different and misleading to convince people otherwise.  

**Data:**
The data that I have analyzed came from Kaggle, and I used an existing visualization done on this data by Cleuton Sampaio to first understand his findings, present my thoughts about it, criticize it, and do a better Visualization using the same data and same metrics that the author of the original Visualization used.

**Project plan:**
This project will be based on exploration rather than confirmation.

1.	Select a topic of interest 
2.	Find credible and reproducible data source 
3.  Analyze the data to come up with a claim 
4.  Add additional data to come up with a counter-argument 
5.	Make several intermediate versions 
6.	Critque the intermediate versions to come up with a final version 
8.	Descibe the final version and scope of improvement 
9.	Make a short video explaining the visual
